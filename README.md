# Socket_File
In this program, we are using sockets in Python to send files from one computer to another computer. Client sends a file, server stores it, and then pushes it to a node according to the file's datatype and deletes its local copy. When client requests for a file, it is tries to find the file on various nodes, and if found, returns the file to the client. #Feature_yet_to_implement.
